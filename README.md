The purpose of this project was to analyze an excel data sheet containing information for a kickstarter company. The sheet included 3888 projects in several different categories including film, technology, journalism, and other forms of the arts. Projects had three different outcomes: successful, failed, and cancelled. These outcomes were determined by the number of donations, if donation goals were met, and if everything was funded by the deadline. Two major analysis were done with this data. First, an inquiry into whether the theatre oucomes were successful in relation to their launch date. Second, an analysis into the relationship between the success of a project and dontation goals.
